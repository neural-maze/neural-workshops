My talk at Aily Labs about the open-source [PhiloAgents course](https://github.com/neural-maze/philoagents-course), in which students will build a simulation of agents inside a video game, where the agents will embody thinkers from ancient times.

Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, Turing, etc.

During this workshop, the fundamentals of what an agent is were explained, as well as how to create agent systems, memory, LLMOps, and Agentic APIs.
